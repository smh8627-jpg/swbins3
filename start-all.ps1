# Starts the 5 AI generation servers fully hidden (no console window at all).
# Each server's stdout/stderr is redirected to logs\<name>.out.log / .err.log,

# "< NUL" on the cmd.exe launches: if the batch script ever hits a `pause` or similar
# prompt, redirecting stdin from NUL makes it return immediately instead of hanging
# forever with no console attached to answer it.
#
# The PID of each launched process is appended to logs\running.pids for reference;
# stop-all.ps1 does NOT rely solely on this (see its own comments) since it is not
# 100% reliable for every launch, and instead primarily matches processes by their
# working directory / command line.
