# Stops the 5 AI generation servers (sd-webui, music-gen, voice-gen, 3d-gen, ai-tools-hub)
# started by start-all.ps1.
#
# Primary method: kill any process whose command line / executable path contains one of
# these service folders, regardless of whether it was tracked by PID or has an open port.
# This avoids leaving zombie processes behind even if PID tracking missed one (e.g. a
# process that never got past a startup hang and never bound its port).
# logs\running.pids and known ports are kept as secondary safety nets.
#
# Does not touch ollama or aider - those are not started by this script.
